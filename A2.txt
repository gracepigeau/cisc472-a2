CISC 472 Assignment 2
Due March 10, 2020 before class


Using the NDI Polaris system:

1. Collect about 400 points to calibrate the stylus with 'pivot
   calibration'.

2. Repeat step 1 to collect a second set of calibration points.

3. Collect about 20 individual points on the surface of the knee
   phantom while the knee is also tracked by its own marker.  Each
   point should be collected by resting the stylus at a particular
   position for a few seconds.

4. Repeat step 3 after moving the knee, but keeping the knee's marker
   attached in the same place.

You should have four CSV files of points after this.  Call them

  pivot_calibration_1.csv
  pivot_calibration_2.csv
  knee_scan_1.csv
  knee_scan_2.csv

  The knee scan data will be used in Assignment 3.


In Matlab, starting with the skeleton code provided:

5. Implement a pivot calibration method using 'fitSphere' and other
   code to determine the best-fit vector to the stylus tip in the
   stylus's *local* coordinate system.

5. Implement a RANSAC variant of 'fitSphere' called 'fitSphereWithRANSAC'.

6. For your two sets of pivot calibration points and for the other set
   provided in this assignment (called pivot_calibration_0.csv),
   determine the best-fit vector using the 'fitSphere' and the
   'fitSphereWithRANSAC'.  For each, record the standard deviation of
   the best-fit vector.  For each, *render* the best-fit vectors (as
   points), along with the ellipsoid of the 95% confidence interval.
   Record the rendered images.

7. What differences between your own pivot calibration data and the
   provided data did you find?  What method was best for handling
   each set of data.  Justify your answer.  What recommendations do
   you have for pivot calibration?


To hand in

8. Create a directory called 'a2'.  In that directory, put these files:

      a2.m
      pivot_calibration_1.csv
      pivot_calibration_2.csv
      calibration_1.png             your rendered image of pivot_calibration_1.csv
      calibration_1_ransac.png      your rendered image of pivot_calibration_1.csv using RANSAC
      calibration_0.png             your rendered image of pivot_calibration_0.csv
      calibration_0_ransac.png      your rendered image of pivot_calibration_0.csv using RANSAC
      README.txt

   The README.txt file should contain your name(s), student number(s),
   and netid(s), along with your answers to #7 above and your best-fit
   vectors and their standard deviation from #6.

   Zip the a2 directory and mail it to jstewart@cs.queensu.ca.
