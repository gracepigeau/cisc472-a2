Question 7:
	Differences between collected and provided pivot calibration data?
		Our collected data had fewer outliers than the provided data. Because data collection was only started once the stylus was in place on the knee model and so the points which can be seen in the provided data from moving the stylus to the model are not present.
	Best method for handling each set of data? Justify.
		For pivot_calibration_0 - the provided data set - RANSAC is the best method for handling the data. Looking at the two spheres and the data points, it's qualitatively obvious that the sphere generated by RANSAC is a better fit to the inlier points. However, RANSAC does have a higher standard deviation. This is possibly because the outliers have a high deviation from the sphere and therefore disproportiantely effect the standard deviation.
		For the two collected data sets there were fewer outliers in the data, therefore the sphere fit with and without RANSAC resulted in very similar values and standard deviations, although the method without RANSAC has marginally smaller standard deviations. Qualitatively, we were not able to see significant improvements in the sphere fit with either method when looking at the graphs of the sphere and points.
	Recommendations for pivot calibration?
		One recommendation for pivot calibration would be to start and end data collection while the stylus is in place. This will minimize the collection of outliers. Another recommendation would be to ensure the stylus is rotated in many directions to maximize the spherical surface covered by the points.
